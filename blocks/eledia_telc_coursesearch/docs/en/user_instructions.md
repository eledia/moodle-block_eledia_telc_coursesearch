Course search is a block which lets you serarch courses for following criteria:  
- Fulltext search of course name and description
- Course category
- If the course is over, ongoing or planned for the future
- Course custom fields
- Tags
You can choose between two result formats: list and cards.
The searchable dropdown fields allow multiple selections and constrain each other. That means: If you select something in one field, the other fields will only show valid selection option which will return results.
  
The plugin consists of two main sections:  
- Search section
- Results section
